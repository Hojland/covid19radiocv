### Prerequisites

Dependencies are installed with poetry, which is installed using

``` bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Most likely you would also like your virtual environment to reside in the project folder, do once as

``` bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
### Installing

Link to your version of python using 

``` bash
poetry env use <python-version>
```

A python version could be installed using

``` bash
pyenv install 3.8.8
```
Currently there are some issues on some platforms with using pyenv to install python. If you experience problems with sqlite3 on amazon linux (redhat distribution) try 

``` bash
yum list | grep sqlite
sudo yum install sqlite-devel.x86_64
pyenv install 3.8.8
```

And you can install the dependencies using 
``` bash
poetry install (or update)
```

### Coding style tests

``` bash
poetry run black src
```
